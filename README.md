# Caroline Hershel Tribute Page

Tribute page dedicated to the first professional woman astronomer, Caroline Hershel.

## Introduction

This project was made as part of the School of Code's pre-course task.

## Why I Chose This Person

During the summer '21, I visited [Hershel Museum of Astronomy](https://herschelmuseum.org.uk/) in Bath, where I learned about William Hershel, who discovered Uranus! However, William was also Caroline's brother which is how I got fascinated by her story as well and wanted to dedicate this tribute page to her.

## What I Learned 

- Adding an image as a background.
- Creating a timeline and making it responsive.
- Styling using purely CSS3.

## Launch
